By 2020-21, about 630,000 farmers had adopted these agroecological practices, reporting lower input costs, improved yields after 2-3 years, and ~10% irrigation water reduction due to better soil moisture retention. The program's success relies on grassroots extension networks, women's Self-Help Groups, and supportive state policy.</p>

Farmers planted shade trees and cover crops in coffee fields, used compost instead of chemical fertilizer, and intercropped with fruit and timber species. The project gained government recognition and demonstrates how public-private-community collaborations can accelerate regenerative agriculture adoption.</p>

These human-designed forest ecosystems preserve biodiversity, maintain soil fertility through continuous leaf litter, and provide families with stable food and income.

                        <p class="resource-excerpt">Unilever's Jasmine Rice Regeneration Project in Northeastern Thailand introduced soil testing and nutrient management that reduced synthetic fertilizer use by 30-40%, along with cover crops in fallow periods. Farmers saw immediate benefits: looser, more fertile soil, fewer pests, and improved flood and drought tolerance, with stable or improved yields and reduced input costs. In Southern Thailand, rubber farmers partnered with organizations to develop agroforestry systems integrating fruit trees and cover crops.</p>

                        <p class="resource-excerpt">In the low-lying areas of Bangladesh, farmers have developed sophisticated rice-fish culture systems that both mitigate flood risks and maximize resource use efficiency. Fish in rice paddies eat mosquito larvae and provide protein, while their movement aerates the water and improves nutrient cycling, reducing the need for fertilizer and enhancing rice yields. This integrated approach demonstrates how farmers combine aquaculture with agriculture to build resilience against flooding while simultaneously improving food security with diverse outputs.</p>

In India, natural farming uses "jeevamrut" (fermented microbial culture from cow dung, urine, and pulse flour) to restore soil biology. Diverse crop rotations with legumes are essential - Nepal's climate-resilient agriculture project enhanced maize-rice rotations by adding legumes, improving soil nitrogen and breaking pest cycles.</p>

                    <h3>Agroforestry and Biodiversity Restoration</h3>
                    <p>Multi-strata agroforestry, as exemplified by Sri Lanka's Kandyan home gardens, combines tall trees, understory trees, shrubs, and crops in complementary arrangements. In Vietnam's Central Highlands, coffee farmers plant fruit or timber trees (durian, avocado, acacia) for shade, leaf litter, and alternative harvests. Boundary planting with vetiver grass or legumes in Nepal stabilizes terraces, while Thailand's rice systems use flowering border strips to attract beneficial insects. Indigenous crop varieties preservation is also critical.</p>

                    <h3>Water Management for Resilience</h3>
                    <p>Best practices include rainwater harvesting through farm ponds and percolation tanks (as in arid parts of India), efficient irrigation methods like drip systems combined with organic mulching (cutting water use by 50% in South India vegetable farms), alternate wetting and drying (AWD) in rice paddies (saving 30% water and reducing methane emissions by 50%), and integrated watershed management. In Bangladesh, rice-fish culture improves water efficiency by using one water body for two productions.</p>

                    <h3>Integrated and Community-Centered Farming</h3>
                    <p>Exemplified by Thailand's Sufficiency Economy farms, which typically integrate paddy, fruit orchard, fish pond, and livestock on a single small farm, creating circular nutrient flows. The classic rice-fish-duck system in India combines ducks for pest control, fish for protein, and improved rice yields. Community-based approaches like Nepal's watershed committees coordinate soil conservation measures across farms. Farmer Field Schools and participatory research have been very effective for disseminating techniques.</p>

                    <h3>Market Linkages and Value Addition</h3>
                    <p>Connecting farmers to markets that reward sustainable produce is crucial. Certification and labeling (Organic, Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance) can provide premium prices, as experienced by Vietnamese coffee farmer Vinh who became one of the first Rainforest Alliance Certified growers. In India, Farmer Producer Organizations formed by natural farming groups directly market pesticide-free food to health-conscious urban consumers. Value addition through on-farm processing (organic jams, herbal teas) can increase income.</p>

                    <h3>Adaptive Management and Continuous Learning</h3>
                    <p>Regenerative agriculture is knowledge-intensive and requires regular monitoring and adaptation. In drought-prone regions of India, farmers keep records of rainfall, soil moisture, and crop performance, then discuss results in farmer groups to adjust practices. Successful regenerative models treat the farm as an evolving system. Partnerships between CGIAR scientists and villages (Climate-Smart Villages initiatives in Bangladesh, Nepal) demonstrate how co-creation of solutions accelerates adoption.</p>
